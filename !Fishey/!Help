SUMMARY

 A desktop magnifier program which produces a `fish-eye' distortion
 effect.

INTRODUCTION

 Fishey works much like any other desktop magnifier, with the
 difference that the magnification varies across the simulated lens:
 it is greatest at the centre, and zero at the edges. This produces a
 barrel distortion effect, where straight lines become curved near the
 edge of the magnifier. Similar barrel distortion is produced by
 fish-eye camera lenses, hence the name.

USE

 Fishey works like any other desktop magnifier, and the choices window
 ought to be fairly self-explanatory. Note that, as with most or all
 magnification programs, Fishey's `follow caret' function won't work
 with Zap or StrongEd, which handle caret drawing themselves and don't
 reveal the caret's position to prying programs.

REQUIREMENTS

 Fishey is written entirely in C, so blazing speed is not one of its
 chief virtues. Size 128 and update 5 cs on my RiscPC 600 seems to go
 pretty reasonably, but it crawls at a size of 256. Apologies to ARM2
 and ARM250 users, who will probably find it well-nigh unusable. 
 Fishey also requires Acorn's Toolbox modules and hence Risc OS 3.10
 or later. [This paragraph was written in 1999 for the first release;
 I imagine there aren't many ARM2 users out there these days.]

 This version is compiled for processors running in 26-bit mode; the
 main motivation for this release (with source) is to enable someone
 to compile a 32-bit version (see acknowledgements section).

 One other thing: Fishey won't work in 4- or 2-colour modes. Sorry
 about this, but it probably wouldn't be worth the effort to do.

TECHNICAL DETAILS

 Fishey builds a table of offsets from which to read in pixels of the
 display (doing it the other way round would lead to gaps, probably). 
 That's about all there is to be said about it. The algorithm for the
 distortion used is based heavily on (though not copied directly from)
 the program !Flyns by [FlY'96]. I can't remember where this came from
 ---I think it was on a Datafile or Acorn User CD-ROM...

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

 Inspiration and the original magnification algorithm came from
 !Flyns. Invaluable development tools were: Zap (Dominic Symes et
 al.), StrongHelp (Guttorm Vik), the Toolbox (Acorn), OSLib (Jonathan
 Coxhead), and ToolLib (Paul Field).

 Thanks for this release are due to Michael Drake, who emailed me out
 of the blue, years after I forgot I'd ever written this program, to
 ask for a 32-bit version, or the means to produce one.
