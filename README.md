Fishey: desktop magnifier for RISC OS
=====================================

Fishey works much like a typical desktop magnifier, with the difference
that the magnification varies across the simulated lens: it is greatest
at the centre, and zero at the edges. This produces a barrel distortion
effect, where straight lines become curved near the edge of the
magnifier. Similar barrel distortion is produced by fish-eye camera
lenses, hence the name.

I wrote this program untold ages ago when I programmed for Acorn
machines. Six years after releasing it and forgetting it, I had a
flattering request for the source in order that a 32-bit version could
be produced. I was, of course, delighted to oblige.
